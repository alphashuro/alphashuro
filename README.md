interests:

- information architecture: how to make solutions to complex problems easier to understand and build
- mental models and metacognition: how to use the brain well, how to think efficiently, how to transfer thoughts and ideas to other humans, and how to transfer skills to other humans

currently working on:

- learning programming language design and implementation: working through [crafting interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com) and building a programming language from scratch<sup>1</sup>
- building a protocol (language) for defining interfaces between networked applications (really just a language for defining RPC over HTTP and websockets, but one that isn't tied to a specific language (e.g. trpc) and doesn't force a myriad of other opinions like transport and serialization methods on you (e.g. grpc))
- learning purescript

other interests:

- practical philosophy
- PC games (Dota 2, Factorio ...)

Fun fact: Some day in the far future, someone will have the very last memory of you for the very last time...

<sup>1</sup> Not quite from scratch, but the examples in the book are slightly more object-oriented and implemented in Java, whereas my implementation is in Rust and a bit more functional. Not very efficient yet though ðŸ˜…
