### Hi there üëã

I'm Alpha, a stoic who greatly values technological advancement for the greater good of mankind, while still having a bit of fun.

I'm passionate about:
- practical philosophy
- self improvement, and helping others improve themselves
- how the mind works and how to optimize it
- learning, pedagogy and metacognition

I believe programming languages are merely tools for expressing solutions, and should communicate the solution to the next developer as effectively as possible while still solving the problem in an efficient and practical way. For this reason, I have explored many languages in my career:
I've spent most of my career writing full stack **javascript** (with **react** on the frontend), I am a fan of functional programming, and I believe strongly in the philosophies that drive **rust** as well as those that drive **go** (albeit for different reasons).

I have dabbled in:
- c++
- haskell
- python
- ruby
- java
