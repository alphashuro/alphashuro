### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Alpha, a stoic who greatly values technological advancement for the good of mankind. 

I'm passionate about:
- practical philosophy
- self improvement, and helping others improve themselves
- intelligence (organic and artificial)
- learning, pedagogy and metacognition

I believe programming languages are merely tools for expressing solutions to problems, and should communicate the solution to the next developer as effectively as possible without incurring a performance cost. Thus, I dabble in many languages.
I've spent most of my career writing full stack **JS**, but I swear by **Rust** and **Golang**. I mostly write frontends in **React**.

I have however dabbled in:
- C++
- haskell
- python
- ruby
- Java

I'm currently learning Machine Learning.

You can reach me at alphashuro@gmail.com

Fun fact: Some day in the far future, someone will have the very last memory of you for the last time...
