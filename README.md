interests:

- information architecture: how to make solutions to complex problems easier to understand and build, especially in a team setting
- mental models and metacognition: how to think more efficiently, how to communicate, and how to transfer skills faster
- self improvement
- practical philosophy

currently working on:

- learning programming language design and implementation by working through [crafting interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com) and building a programming language from scratch<sup>1</sup>
- building a protocol (language) for defining interfaces between networked applications (really just a language for defining RPC over HTTP and websockets, but one that isn't tied to a specific language (e.g. trpc) and doesn't force a myriad of other opinions like transport and serialization methods on you (e.g. grpc))
- learning purescript

Fun fact: Some day in the far future, someone will have the very last memory of you for the very last time...
