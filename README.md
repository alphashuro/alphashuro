### Hi there üëã

I'm Alpha, a stoic philosopher who greatly values technological advancement (and having fun while doing so).

I'm passionate about:
- entrepreneurial problem solving and systems thinking
- practical philosophy
- self improvement, growth, and helping others improve
- learneng how the mind works and how to use/optimize it efficiently
- learning, pedagogy and metacognition

### Core philosophy

I am driven by the desire to solve problems that plague humans, and I believe technology is the greatest enabler of that in our zeitgeist.

### Technical specifications

I'm about 1.73m tall, and I believe that, after solving the actual business problem in a way that is scalable and observable, communication is the next most important practice in software engineering. The code we write is a form of communication to the next engineer, and the systems we design and build can only be maintained and extended if they are well communicated.

I've spent most of my career writing full stack **typescript** (with **react** on the frontend), I enjoy functional programming, and I greatly value in pragmatism and simplicity in my work (note that "simple" does not equal "easy").

I have dabbled in:
- go
- c++
- haskell
- python
- ruby
- java
