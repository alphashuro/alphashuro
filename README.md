Hi!

I'm Alpha, a software engineer trying to find meaning in existence.

My core interests:

- information architecture: how to make solutions to complex problems easier to understand and build
- mental models and metacognition: how to use the brain well, how to think efficiently, how to transfer thoughts and ideas to other humans, and how to transfer skills to other humans
- cognitive science: how "thinking" works and how to simulate/re-create it

other interests:

- practical philosophy
- PC games (Dota 2, Factorio ...)

Fun fact: Some day in the far future, someone will have the very last memory of you for the very last time...
