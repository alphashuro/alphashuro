I'm Alpha, a software engineer trying to find meaning in existence.

My core interests:

- Information architecture: how to make solutions to complex problems easier to understand and build
- Mental models and metacognition: how to use the brain well, how to think efficiently, how to transfer thoughts and ideas to other humans, and how to transfer skills to other humans
- Cognitive science: how "thinking" works and how to simulate/re-create it

Other interests:

- Practical philosophy
- PC games (Dota 2, Factorio ...)

Fun fact: Some day in the future, someone will have the very last thought/memory of you for the very last time...
